strange
oh
no like i keep seeing it come online and then logging out immediately
on the markov end or your end o_O
it crashes?
what do you mean
why does markovbot keep dying
thats a pretty nice proect
: lol
wtf LOOOL
https://github.com/alex-wyc/APCSFinalProect/graphs/code-frequency
notice anything strange? https://github.com/alex-wyc/APCSFinalProect/graphs/contributors
that reminds me
OH LOL
beef it up
because the text files
yes
i think you're okay
:expressionless:
well once you send the pull request
-
I think I ust feel like I should be doing more stuff because it looks like I've done zero lines of code in the graphs -___
yeah it's not a big deal
deal
LOL okay probably not a big dela
I give up screw this
it'll look the same as the non-speech line
but then if the user says &lt;@ownuserid|daltonwu&gt; something something
it looks like the user automatically says it upon entering a channel
oh it's complicated
um
yes that's what I'm thinking about
is it a special user
what about the user
it's a message because it shows up in the message feed
smh slack
how is that a message
yes type == 'message'
oh what
no, I do check type
type would equal message
oh you can check type
I can filter out the messages from slack
wait, probably Slack says it
yeah you cant tell
lol
LOL
so we probably would be ok not including it
no, if I say it, then it's proper speech
its still not proper speech
or maybe not
they both end up looking the same
however, I can also literally type the same thing here
when a user oins the channel, that's the way it shows up when I grab the history
no, I mean
then dont write it into the file
cant you ust say if string[:9] == &lt;@USER_ID|
I'm being almost unintelligible rn
idk how to distinguish -_-
but if you literally type that
&lt;@USER_ID|USERNAME&gt;
when user oins the channel
although there's a problem
alright
no, I'm using regex
or you could put it in a text editor and ust replace with that lol
the files are small
there arent even that many
you could probably ust do it manually
I'm doing it now
regex?
what built in
Nah you can ust use some built in methods to ust read in the file and remove instances of unwanted stuff too.  Oh I guess I can do it 
how are you going to code
oh, no felicity
(Sorry I haven't been doing ack poops. I don't have access to computer this weekend)
Or check to see if there's a certain tag those messages have
If statements?
Maybe  can look into removing those from the output?
&lt;!channel&gt;: instead of @channel:
&lt;https&gt; tags instead of the link
like user left/oined channel
the output contains some stuff we might not want, though
okay, I've got the history saving now
lol
make history
and then I was thinking my code would run if you type
do we need a Makefile
Actually not really it can be useful
Yeah when you read it in from a file there's a new line. It's dumb 
ty
???? D:&lt;
fixed it
you have to take out the new line in the token
oh got it
im so confused
are you alive
roy
:thumbsup::skin-tone-6:
ust the first function
yeah
I pushed my code, could you go over it please?
lol
invalid auth
or make your own bot
smh
oh ust use the bot's token
re-issued my token, but still not working
guys, are your tokens in the format of xoxp then three numbers then hex?
D:&lt;
wth slack is reecting my perfectly valid token
you can do commands like //markov talk like random
lol
oh sweet
softdev bot will be better
random bot will be dumb
CHANNEL_NAME_history.txt
so like it will mimic the general style of channel
yes that is what I am doing
we should do &lt;channel-name&gt;.txt
"you are what you eat"
methinks
LOL okay so sometimes it'll be a dumb bot
and stuff
this way we can have shakespearebot
which txt to read in
I'll back up as many channels as is reasonable and then have the markovbot pick
if you use random
it'll be a really dumb bot
like the bot would ust say weird things
ikr
wait but wouldn't it be like a dumb bot if you use the text from random
oh, doesn't matter I'll generate both
oh, I thought we were doing random first
k
probably
ohh okay yeah ust pull from general
do we even have that many -_-
and I think 1000 messages will do it
pulling more means the bot more closely approximates the channel
pulling more doesn't mean the bot becomes more coherent
oh lol we can ust pull more if the bot is incoherent
what dya think
or else I have to do some extra code
yes
oh the max is 1000 at one time?
?
whats the difference between pulling 10,000 though
does that sound like it's enough -_-
I'm feeling kinda lazy so I'll only pull up to 1000 messages instead of all of them
okay guys
then yeah ust get rid of flask
oh also pip install requests
lol
no...
for the class?
?
uhh idk do we have to use flask&gt;
i think ust pip install websocket-client
and also why is flask there
to run app.py?
what do we need to pip install
oh yeah roy
nah we can use it to turn on and off the bot in channels
I think we'll use it ust once -__-
yeah would be useful
well, now I'm writing a function for getting channel id using channel name
lol kk
nvm, then
and i print all reults
yeah that makes sense
okay
slack sends back the channel id when you message
console
how did you get the id for #markov-bot-testing?
oh no i ust messaged the channel and checked the console
no, your code for getting the channel id
the username method
I can't find it -_-
since you've already written it
where's your code loop
https://api.slack.com/methods/channels.list
dalton i think you can do the same thing i did with the userid. use channel.list and loop through until you find a match
oh ok
i was ust messaging the channel and looking at the son sent back
oh and yeah got it yicheng. ust wanted to have channel restriction so it doesnt spam everyone on slack
can you like check the id using slack online
I'm doing it using api
do you have a way to get channel id
oh
yeah, I'm using your code
thats the markov-bot-testing channel
I added Python code for making and adding files but didn't do anything with the API
k
: i'll fix backend like tomorrow
only pull request when it's like "releasable"
roy don't pull request that frequently
: I see channel G0EHE something. Which channel is that?
Do we have some util for grabbing channel id?
Felicity?
what files thing?
So did you?
oh
thats the bots token
?
Dalton, you used my files thing for Python?
that's your token
royxu uploaded a file: https://stuycs.slack.com/files/royxu/F0EHEB5E3/token.txt|token.txt
test
uhh sure
shall we make a special channel for the markov bot spam testing? It's getting crowded in here
yeah copy it. thats fine
oh yeah ust make a utils.py
KING lashes out at the boat.
: can you fix the space before a period thing?

what
EXT. BUCKLEBERRY FERRY -- NIGHT .
(you'll see)
: should we make a utils for the connection stuff, because I'm copying your code in some places
: I'm editing our code rn, so don't edit at the same time
k
Oh yeah I'll go do that 
: why is your token in the actual code? I thought we are saving our own tokens in token.txt and ust reading the token from there
-_-
2 lazy
but you can ust edit the channel name in the code
don't we ust use the history like your fellowship thing
save a config file
no we're not
we aren't running this every time, though
prompt the user for slack team and slack channel
erm prompt the user
or should I grab every channel as a separate file ust to save it
yeah that's good
yeah make a txt
history.txt
I'll make it a txt
which channel
and store it in a file
yes
write something that would grab the chat history
good
I'm actually doing work now

yeech uploaded a file: https://stuycs.slack.com/files/yeech/F0EE5DSG5/even_set_up_a_reminder_for_you.png|even set up a reminder for you.png and commented: I was about to review your pull request lol
: bffl, help me? c:
I'm not sure how to use the URL/code stuff
ROYY
Could someone hold my hand and walk me through API stuff?
Okay. Sorry lol
idk but it was a merge request lol
Or ust the message history branch?
Did the merge request merge with master?
that defeats the purpose of a merge request
felicity don't approve your own merge request lol
I think I got the file writing to work. I'm not sure how to do the API stuff :confused:
everythings back to normal
sorry about that
