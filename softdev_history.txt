@U0AGP4JMA
We'll talk about this tomorrow in class
Any good books/guides on python, specifically the stylistic end? Curious about what exactly is the “python way”. Preferably not geared towards beginners
@channel: CSTUY, which, coincidentally, is my non-profit is hosting its first hackathon of the year, def hacks("Winter",2015) on December 12th.

You're welcome to attend either as a participant or a mentor (last year, many softdev students acted as mentors to beginners from other schools and it worked out great).

More info can be found here: http://defhacks.com

If you want to sign up as a mentor, just email me. If you want to sign up as a participant, follow the instructions on the page. It's going to be held in Manhattan at Facebook's NY Office (a little south of Union Square).
@channel: remember - api project is due on Monday but we'll have lessons Thursday and Friday
@U0AFA8YBG: explain
@U08PSCRAT: Can we add other stuy students who want to self study softdev material?
Hi guys! I know this is late but is there any groups in PD 6 that have less than 4 ppl so i can join? Been trying to ask people directly but everyone’s groups are full. I’m free all night and can do whatever u need me to. Please let me know asap!!
Btw my name is Shawn
Hello friends. I'm bad so I didn't join a group in time, can anyone in Period 7 let me into their group? My specialty is HTML/CSS/JQuery/Bootstrap which may or may not be useful in this project but I can still work on other stuff!
@channel: Sacha Chua does a lot of stuff in the emacs community - she's been doing blog posts with upates on emacs related news and packages. If you're using emacs, you might want to follow her blog: http://sachachua.com/blog/2015/11/2015-11-02-emacs-news/
@channel: If you haven't done so already you should all sign up for your github student developer pack.

Also, that is a mortal sin, you have been excommunicated from the church of CS 
*ahem* kill/yank 
Level -1. Incompetence.

You've done something horribly wrong. Emacs is apparently installed but crashes sporadically and won't let you use copy and paste. You suspect this is a sign. You go back to programming in the Github website.
@channel: Worth a look: http://blog.vivekhaldar.com/post/3996068979/the-levels-of-emacs-proficiency
The mongo server needs to be running
i feel like I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be, lol. sry
"could not connect to server"
yea, I'm not connected to mongo
test mongo to make sure the mongo server is running and you can connect to its instance
did mongodb install correctly?
the config isn't working
i can take a look at it
sure
@channel:  Any of you Linux folk want to see if we can get http://zulip.org|zulip.org installed?
`ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
tl; dr
It lets you install all sorts of useful packages.
Okay, you're going to need to install Homebrew. http://brew.sh
brew is not a recognized command :disappointed:
that will start the mongo daemon
then do `mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf`
just in a terminal
no
in the virtualenv or no?
`brew install mongodb`
do
yes
oh wait do i need to install Mongo too?
but i installed pymongo...?
Mongo isn't running on your computer

Having trouble testing our code through the terminal. I'm in the virtualenv and already installed pymongo, but i keep getting errors like this. Any ideas? 
@channel: remember to bring in a printed out copy of your "code review" tomorrow. Make sure to include your group member names as well as the other group member names and both project repo links.

Also email the review to the other group (or dm)
@channel: If you are having trouble doing the create-a-branch thing, check the file .gitconfig in your home directory - if it says under the [push] section "default = matching" change it to "default = simple"
more to come in a few days
@U08PSCRAT: thxs a lot!

@U08PSCRAT: bloginatorCJFM update:

All we've really done so far is refactoring the HTML templates. The CSS in each file is pretty redundant and pretty confusing tbh. 
The SQLite code also goes through CSV, which works but is inefficient, so we might have to streamline a lot.
Hopefully once we finish that, we can start converting to Mongo? 

Optimal due date: Next Thursday (Nov 5) (EA/ED deadlines pls)
Optimal labdays: 3
@U08PSCRAT:  dopeSQL update:

We're working on refactoring the SQLite code but it's taking longer than expected because the code originally made use of locally stored DB files (and directory searches for ".db") but MongoDB saves all of its files non-locally and we're still not sure how to work around that. 

HTML looks pretty good, but we have a few more updates planned for it, the original group's HTML was really well organized (apparently made use of a master file that each html file extended).

Optimal duedate: Next Monday (Nov 2)
Optimal labdays: 3
Minutes into project: 20
Annoyance at original group: Steadily rising
MEAN development ftw
@U0AGP4JMA: day 1, we saw a presentation by Amanda's group. There project had their own CSS and limited their character numbers. We didn't discuss much about their presentation but rather, Z went over how to "extend" templates so that you don't need to copy past code as well as blocks using Jinja. (Check the classcode) An advantage is that it's more concise. However, you may not want this all the time as some pages are just too different / has too many small changes for it to be useful. 
@U0AGP4JMA:  I don't know about Day1 because I was absent too but today we had Krzysztof's group present and then Z began teaching about the art of presenting properly. He basically said to not hog the spotlight, avoid saying "I", and don't direct/command people during the presentation because it gives off a "lone wolf" vibe. After that we started the very basics of NoSQL (which is apparently a misnomer) and we will be using MongoDB for it, but we didn't start covering the details
@channel: hey guys I've been out the last two days. can someone fill me in on what i missed please?
