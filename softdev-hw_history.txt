<!channel>: This is for Friday 11/6 since I won't be in school.

Form a small group (2-4 people). Each group should find some API online. Some suggestions (and places to look):


NYC Data Mine
Flickr
tumblr
NY Times
openweathermap
Search on Socrata or programmableweb

Write a small flask app that does something fun or cool.

I gave a couple of examples in class.

You won't finish this on Friday - continue it as a project that will be due mid to late next week. You should use github and branches. I'll put up a quackpad for you to "register" the repo addresses next week.
